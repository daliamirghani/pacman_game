////Game development presentation/////

Main menu//// made by creating a class and including each option it it as a function. 

Map ////was created using a 2D array of rectangles, both blue and black. Yellow dots were placed in the blue tiles to represent coins. 

Levels /////were made using boolean variables and increment system. Score counter added different values for small coins, large coins, strawberry and cherry.  Both were presented on screen as strings of text. 

Pacman animation movement//// was made by using a sprite sheet and the function setRectangleRect. Same thing with ghosts. 

Pacman movement///// within the path was tricky as it wasn’t moving in the vector. Our solution to this was to divide the coordinates of the pacman by a factor, which essentially makes it move in an “invisible array”. This method wasn’t the best as it resulted in slightly misaligned movement. 

The ghosts/// being “ghosts” do not move within the path, to increase the difficulty of the game. They target the pacman using a comparison of coordinates, they will increase their coordinates to match up with the current position of the pacman. 

Score////Once the score reached a certain number, the ghost sprite changed its texture and was removed off screen after it collides with the pacman. 

Sound effects//// were added accordingly with each significant change.


Bugs ///
The movement isn’t completely smooth, pacman may not make turns perfectly and sometimes moves on the margins.

Sometimes the ghosts spawn at the starting point and pacman is stuck, please restart the game in this case.

Slight voice effect lag when it comes to the 'pacman eats ghost' scenario
